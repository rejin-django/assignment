Instructions for the User:-
Run the main.py script to start the Employee Management System.
Use the menu to interact with the system, following the prompts for each action.
You can add or remove departments and employees, display departments, list employees in a department, and save/load data.
Ensure you save your data before exiting if you want to keep changes.
To test the system, run the test_employee_management.py script using a Python test runner like unittest.

Comments and Design Decisions:-
Encapsulation: Employee and Department attributes are managed through class methods.
Error Handling: Checks for the existence of departments and employees to avoid errors.
Data Persistence: Optional saving and loading of company data using JSON for simplicity.
Unit Tests: Basic tests to validate the functionality of core methods.

This implementation covers all the requirements outlined and provides a solid foundation for an Employee Management System using OOP principles and Python.
